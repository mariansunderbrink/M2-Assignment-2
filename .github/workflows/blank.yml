# Task 1

# Import data set
subsidies <- read_excel("C:/Users/marian/Desktop/subsidies.csv")
subsidies <- read.csv("subsidies.csv", col_names = TRUE)
subsidies <- fread("subsidies.csv", dec = ",")

# Checking the structure of the data set
View(subsidies)
summary(subsidies)
str(subsidies)
is.na(subsidies)

# Show adjacency matrix
adj_mat


# Selection of a federal state
sub_nrw <- subsidies %>%
  filter(Nordrhein-Westfalen,
# ?((how to connect the connection of the state to other states by the same project_id?))


# Show all projects in which organizations from this state are involved

subsidies <- subsidies %>%
  filter(!is.na(project_id)) ?
 
# Show edgelist; Number of edges in the network
edge_list

# Transform the filtered data set in an igraph object
subsidies <- graph_from_data_frame(sub_project_id = edge_list, vertices = node_info, directed = FALSE)

#=============
# Task 2


# Transform the two-mode network into one mode projection; containing organizations only
bipartite_mapping(Actor)
bipartite_projection(Actor)
# how to combine with same project_id?




#==============
# Task 3

# Number of components in the network?  

sub_nrw_comps <- decompose(sub_nrw)
sub_nrw_comps

# Extract the largest component
plot(sub_nrw,
     vertex.size = 4,
     vertex.label.cex = 0,8,
     vertex.label.color = "black")


#================
# Task 4

# Calculate the three node-level centralities & assign the three centralities as additional node attributes

# 1/3 Degree Centrality
deg <- degree(sub_nrw, mode = "all")
sort(deg)

# Assign degree centrality as additional node attribute
V(sub_nrw)$deg <- d

# 2/3 Betweenness centrality
V(sub_nrw) <- betweenness(sub_nrw, directed = TRUE)
sort(V(sub_nrw))$btw


# 3/3 Closeness centrality
closeness(sub_nrw)

#==============
# Task 4a

# Calculate a correlation matrix containing the three centralities.


# How are the centralities related?


#===============
# Task 4b

# Which are the most important nodes based on the degree and the betweenness centrality?



#================
# Task 5

# Visualize the network. Size of nodes based on betweenness centrality

plot(sub_nrw)
bipartite_mapping(sub_nrw)

g <- graph_from_data_frame(project_id, directed = FALSE)
V(g)$type <- bipartite_mapping(g)$type

# ?? g_bipartite <- bipartite_projection(g)


#================
# Task 6

# Is the network a small world?
